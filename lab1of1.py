# Quiz: List Indexing

# To determine the number of days in the month of august
month = 8

# 
days_in_month = [31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31]

# Using list indexing to determine the number of days in month and accounting for zero-based indexing!
# Using square bracket to access the 8th month in the variable days_in_month and assigning it to variable num_days
num_days = days_in_month[7]

print(num_days)
